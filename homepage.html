            Josh Flood sits quietly staring at the front doors of Walkerton District Community School where a growing memorial sits outside the front doors - a school that won’t feel the same come Monday, says Flood, following the deaths of four of his fellow students, and one of his favourite teachers.

“The four girls were great, amazing, bright students. Everybody loved them. And, [Matt] Eckert, such a great guy. Always had a smile on his face. Always knew how to cheer you up,” says Flood, a Grade 13 student at Walkerton District Community School.

On Friday afternoon, around 4:30, an SUV driven by the teacher, and carrying four teenage girls, collided with a tractor trailer at the intersection of Cobble Hills Road and Thorndale Road.


All five occupants of the SUV died. They were on their way home to Walkerton from a school softball tournament in Dorchester.
